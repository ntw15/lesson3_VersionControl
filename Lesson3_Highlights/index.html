            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that allows changes to single or multiple files so that you can open certain versions of the file/files later. In graphic and web design, version control can be critical because it has the ability to keep every version or layout of a design that you may have done. This allows files to be reverted back to their previous states, no matter how long ago they were saved. Other than reverting these files, Version Control Systems allow for programmers to compare changes, see who is modifying the files, when an issue was apparent, along with many other features.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Local Version Control Systems are many people’s version-control of choice. This method essentially is the copying of files into a separate directory. It is a method of choice because it is quite simple. The only issue with this type of system is that it is extremely prone to inaccuracy. This approach is difficult to maneuver because directories are confused with others and files are often overwritten accidentally. Centralized Version Control Systems then allowed developers to collaborate while on different systems. Centralized systems run the risk of losing everything because their storage is all centralized in one space. Distributed Version Control Systems allow for clients to fully access the repository. Although each system is important, the most important thing is the progression and growth of each Version Control System.

            <p class="lead">Git began as a free tool founded by the developers of the Linux kernel and a commercial company. Eventually, the relationship between the two parties dissolved and “Bitkeeper” was no longer a free service. Bitkeeper was a DVCS that the Linux kernel used to begin their project. The Linux community responded by making their own tool similar to the Bitkeeper. This tool had improved speed, simpler design, stronger support in development, better distribution, and more efficient in the ability to handle large projects. Since both the Bitkeeper and the Linux Kernel’s conception, Git has evolved and become much easier to use.

            <p class="lead">Git is very important in web application development. Understanding its fundamentals will help make Git more effective to use. Git is different than other VCSs (Subversion, Perforce) and separating these tools will allow for a better understanding of Git. Git doesn’t store data like other systems. It thinks of its data more like a set of snapshots of a small filing system. All files are saved without being overwritten and allows for an easy reference point. Essentially, this data is like a stream of snapshots. Along with being a mini filesystem, Git allows for  many powerful tool to be built alongside it.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Another important distinction between Git and other VCSs is that it only needs local files/resources in its operation; no information is needed from another computer on your network. An example of this is browsing the history to look for old versions of a file. All changes are able to be seen no matter the length of time between it and the original file thanks to it all being accessible on the local database. Another interesting feature of Git is that it “checksums” every time a change is made. This makes changing contents of files and directories impossible without Git knowing about it.
