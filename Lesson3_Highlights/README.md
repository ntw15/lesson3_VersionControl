## Project Description:
This assignment sums up what I learned throughout this lesson.
From Version Control to Git to creating a Github account, this assignment 
highlights what I thought was most interesting.

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:

1. Version control is a system that allows changes to single or multiple files 
   so that you can open certain versions of the file/files whenever.

2. Git doesnâ€™t store data like other systems. It thinks of its data more like a 
   set of snapshots of a small filing system. All files are saved without being 
   overwritten and allows for an easy reference point.

3. Version Control Systems allow for programmers to compare changes, see who is 
   modifying the files, when an issue was apparent, along with many other 
   features
